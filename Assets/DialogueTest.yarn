You've forgotten the sound of her voice. 
But she left you a fragment of it.
Burnt in steel, sharp and cutting. A song to open.

Journal: "It's interesting that the new arrival, the cleric, is of the order of the Saint of Radiant Sorrow."
Journal: "Quite a violent sect. Staged a coup in White Stair."
Journal: "Maybe her faith has the same effect as the music thing? Does the Beneath feed on it?"
Journal: "The Saint <i>did</i> only become something after she died, preserved as a shell."
Journal: "Very morbid. But also, the liquid light of the Saint, and the underwater Sun here..."
Journal: "Could there be a connection there too? Or am I speculating too wildly?"

Book: "And, his patience rewarded, Sylvan the Overcomer, with his legendary strength,"
Book: "wrestled the Worldeater Fish, covered its gills with his hands,"
Book: "so it gasped, and shuddered, and surfaced,"
Book: "and Sylvan threw it out of the water and onto the shore,"
Book: "where he carved it open, and removed the Moon, which it had consumed."
